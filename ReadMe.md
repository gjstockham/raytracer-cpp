# C++ Raytracer

This is the implemented code from the book "Raytracing in one Weekend" by Peter Shirley.  This code only implements as far as the moveable camera, and not the depth-of-field effects.

No changes or optimisations, other than to move the file write out of the main loop so that I can put a stopwatch around it.

For benchmarking against my other ports of this work, on my PC this runs in 14000ms debug and 950 release  (Win10 x64, i7-4790K, 32GB RAM)
